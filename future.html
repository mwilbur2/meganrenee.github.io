            <section class="place"><h3>6 months</h3>
                <p>Hopefully in six months I will be in the middle of the fall semester of my senior year. With any luck, I will be able to have kicked a lot of my <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=abstract&utm_content=Major-depression&utm_campaign=Knowledge-panel">mental health issues</a> in the ass and come out stronger than where I'm at currently. I will have completed my internshop at <a href="case.edu">Case Western Reserve</a> for the second year in a row, and I will begin looking for possible employment opportunities. I will also have my entire living situation figured out by that point and will have hopefully signed a lease for a new apartment closer to campus with a friend.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="place"><h3>1 year</h3>
                <p>In a year, I'm hoping to be preparing for my own graduation. With any luck, I will have a job opportunity lined up, presumably either here at <a href="www.kent.edu">Kent</a> or at <a href="case.edu">Case Western Reserve.</a>
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="place"><h3>5 years</h3>
                <p>In five years, I should be in a <a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Web_Developer/Salary">stable job</a>, and, with any luck, I'll be looking to purchase a house for myself instead of renting. I would like to believe my best friend that just turned 4 will still be with me in 5 years, and she'll continue to be my <a href="http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/labrador-retriever/">partner in crime.</a> </p>
            </section>
            <section class="place"><h3>10 years</h3>
                <p>The plan is to have started a family in 10 years, or by the time I'm 31. If my dog has passed on by this point, I'll definitely have <a href="http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/labrador-retriever/">another friend by my side</a> who will undoubtedly cause trouble everywhere she goes. Hopefully I will have <a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Web_Developer/Salary">my career</a> completely in line and be very happy with where I'm at. I'm planning on staying somewhere in Northeast Ohio, but who knows where life will take me.</p>
