            <section class="place"><h3>Smithsonian Natural History Museum</h3>
                <p>Located in Washington, D.C., the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History opened in 1910 and has been inspiring people ever since. This place is filled with so much information and historical pieces that I could very easily go through this museum for a week and still not see everything. <br><a href="https://naturalhistory.si.edu/about/">More Information About the Smithsonian</a></p>

            <section class="place"><h3>Garrettsville, Ohio</h3>
                <p>This is my hometown, and as such is a place that is very near and dear to my heart. This location is more about nostalgic purposes then anything else. There was a massive fire here not long ago which burned down half of the town, but this litle town is resilient and keeps working to stay alive. <br> <a href="">More About Garrettsville</a></p>

            <section class="place"><h3>Walt Disney World</h3>
                <p>Walt Disney World was one of the first major trips I remember taking with family, and it left a really positive impression on me as a child. I went back with the high school marching band when I was a junior, and I loved it even more the second time! <br> <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/special-offers/?&type=room-offer,package-offer&CMP=KNC-FY18_WDPR_WDW_TRA_DOM-EXCFL_WorldResorts_WDW-Brand|BR|G|4181250.RR.AM.01.02|NA_NA_NA_&keyword_id=kwd-275863331|dc|waltdisneyworld|228140005854|p|5060:3|&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI4MqC2tOe2QIVyyaGCh3XvQW-EAAYASAAEgJW6vD_BwE&s_kwcid=AL!5060!3!228140005854!p!!g!!waltdisneyworld&ef_id=Wnc7IgAAAFwJTzCT:20180211200150:s">Book A Trip</a></p>

            <section class="place"><h3>The Korean War Memorial</h3>
                <p>Located in Washington, D.c. This memorial holds a special place to me because my grandfather fought in this war. Not only that, but he also met my grandmother there, and shortly after the war is when she decided to come to America. This memorial is a beautiful tribute to the war in Korea. <br><a href="">More About the Korean War Memorial</a> </p>

            <section class="place"><h3>Cuyahoga Valley National Park</h3>
                <p>This is just a really gorgeous national park that is quite large. My friends and I enjoy hiking through the area, and it's one of the places we like to go when the weather is nice. We also have biked the towpath on occassion. <br> <a href="https://www.nps.gov/cuva/index.htm">Learn More About CVNP</a></p>
